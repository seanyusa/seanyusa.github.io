### What did you do this past week?

This week was interesting for my proctor position. The students turned in their first lab assignments. I graded a lot of them over the weekend but still have quite a few to grade. Now I know a bit more of how my graders must feel having to grade all our projects and assignments. It's a very tedious process. I still want to be able to setup a routine though.

### What's in your way?

I think that the biggest thing that is in the way of setting up a routine is that I need to get my priorities straight. If other things are more of a priority then say exercise then I will be spending more time doing those things than worrying about exercise. So I believe I need to ask myself and see what are the things that are most important to me. 

### What will you do next week?

Next week I'm going to hopefully plan out what I am going to want to be doing. Hopefully I can set my priorities straight. Also I hope that I will be able to get ahead on my assignments and programming projects and reading so that way I can focus on what my priorities are and be able to actually execute them.

### This Class

I wonder what the next project will be. Hopefully we will be able to do a bit of pair projects. I think it is a lot more efficient to be able to have people working together and sharing ideas to be able to come to a better and more clean solution more quickly. I think that the assignments so far are not bad despite the fact that I spent so much of my life trying to pass the Sphere Online Judge. I will that was not part of the assignment because I have no idea what I am doing. Doesn't seem very intuitive to have to guess at what I'm doing, or maybe I'm just approaching it all wrong.

**Tip-of-the-week:** 
Mainstage for Mac is a really cool live performance software for music. I've been using it recently to create my own sounds and play music!
