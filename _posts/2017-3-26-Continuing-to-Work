title: Continuing to Work
---

Have been continuing to work on this project and it seems to be going well. It is a decently interesting project so I'm glad to be working on it in this class.

### What did you do this past week?
This past week we got a chance to work on our final project group project. It was pretty interesting as we got to work together in different ways and it seemed pretty interesting to collaborate together on this kind of project. It seemed like there were definitely parts that were hard and parts that were easy. It seemed like the design parts were more challenging for us over all as we had a harder time to be able to come to agreements or decisions just because of the open ended natural of projects. Other implementation parts were actually easier like making the front end and actually coding. I think I really enjoyed doing the group project as I enjoy getting the change to be able to work together as a bigger group and have more collaboration beyond just yourself. I feel like these blogs were a big help too when doing the technical report for the group project as I was able to write more easily from having practiced writing out my ideas in these weekly blogs.

### What’s in your way?
I think that time is and still will always be a big factor in each and every person’s life. You can want to do a lot of things but ultimately at the end there will only be opportunity to do a limited amount of things. Imagine if we could do an unlimited amount of things, then we could learn everything, we could make whatever we wanted, think about anything, but the reality is that we do not. So we must choose what is important to us and what we want to do with our lives.

### What will you do next week?
Next week we will be continuing to work on our group project. Hopefully it will continue to be fun and we will be able to progress well on our group project.

### This Class
This class is very helpful on being able to learn at least a bit of technologies that I have not used before. It is also helpful for learning to work together with different people which is an important skill I feel.

**Tip-of-the-week:** Slack is a useful tool for communicating with others to be able to make different groups. You can also subscribe to different chats as a user of the application to choose what notifications you want to get.

**Todo: Continue to work on the group project.**
