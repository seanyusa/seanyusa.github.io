title: Exam Time!
---

This week has been exam week and next week will also be exam time! I feel like my software design exam went okay, we'll see how well I did hopefully this week if he grades the exam in time. Then this week I will be taking my Software Engineering exam. I sort of wonder what that will be like. I guess a majority of the exam will be about Python? Hopefully it won't be too bad.

### What did you do this past week?

I studied for my Software Design exam and took the exam this week. Then I worked on some grading for my Database class that I am proctoring. There were lots of assignments to grade and my grading scripts were failing on a lot of projects because of the just the abnormalities found. I have a lot more respect for the people that have graded my programming assignments in the past now.

### What's in your way?

I still want to get more excercise in my routine and there is just so little time in the day for everything that I want to get done. I hope that I would be able to include some of it as I continue to flesh out my priorities.

### What will you do next week?

I need to start studying for my Software Design class so that I don't fail my class! Also we'll be getting our next assignment for Software Engineering so it'll be interesting to see what that is.

### This Class

I am excited to see what the exam will be like. Sad that I'll probably have to miss the special talk about the Google Cloud and the quiz. haha. Hopefully the upcoming big project will be fun as we work with more people and have more code to put together.

**Tip-of-the-week:** 
Alexa can control different parts of your home and remember different things for you. Wouldn't it be cool if Alexa had a screen or display that would display different things for it around the home as well???

**Todo: Study for Software Engineering.**
