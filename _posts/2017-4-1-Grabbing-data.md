title: Grabbing Data
---

Right now on our group project we are working on pulling data from the API that we have choose to use. We hope to pull all the data that we need so that we can save it in the database and then be able to use it for our own API.

### What did you do this past week?
We have been continuing to work on our group project this week. This week has been more focused on the backend and the data collection process. We have been using the requests library to call the API that we chose to use and we parse the json response and import the data into our database. So far we have just been working on small subsets of the data such as only information for one state. This way we can make sure that we are importing data correctly first and then be able to later import the data correctly for the entire dataset. Hopefully we will finish that soon and then be able to work towards formatting the data and also getting it hooked up to the front end for display as well later.

### Whatâ€™s in your way?
There are many activities that are happening in my life. Lots of things to do and to be completed. I think that I definetly wish I had more personal time to myself but that time with others is very good as well, spending time with other working on different things. I think that if we only had more time then that means more things could be done but doesn't that mean we just need to make all the more efficient use of our time.

### What will you do next week?
Next week we will be finishing up our group project and we will be able to start wrapping it up. Hopefully we will be able to continue to work on the project and maybe even get ahead on the project.

### This Class
This class is very helpful on being able to learn at least a bit of technologies that I have not used before. We have been needed to collaborate alot so I have enjoyed just experiencing and learning how to work with other people together.

**Tip-of-the-week:** Asana is a useful platform to be able to collaborate and plan project with other people. It allows different groups to be formed and different projects to be started. You can track the progress of different parts of the project and see when you complete tasks!

**Todo: Continue to work on the group project.**
