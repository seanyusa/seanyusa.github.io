title: Time for Break
---

It has been a nice week of exams. Finally most of them have passed. I still have another exam right before spring break but that is for my music class and it shouldn't be too bad. Going to be a great time for a week longs break to get ready for the last half of the semester. I will be able to get a chance to go back home for a bit.

### What did you do this past week?

I took my software engineering exam this past week. There was only one curve that seemed difficult and it was how to define functions with optional parameters using the * symbol. I may have missed this one as it is actually not clear whether or not I need the keyword arguments. I should have went over this a bit more as it seems we did a lot of function unpacking but not very much review of this topic. But other than that I don't think that it was that bad at all. Seemed like a pretty fair exam.

### What's in your way?

I have actually been getting more exercise in my week. Hopefully I will be able to setup some more consistent routine that is maybe every other day or even daily if the time permits. Still the things in the way are going to be myself and the limited time that I have each week.

### What will you do next week?

I will be needing to complete my assignments for software design. Also we are going to be getting the group assignment for software engineering. I believe that our group still needs to find one partner for the project.

### This Class

Hopefully the upcoming big project will be fun as we work with more people and have more code to put together. We hopefully will get to do some of the pair programming stuff that we have been reading about and actually see how it works in real life. I actually enjoy this class because it seems like we are doing actual things that are more practical for the work place.

**Tip-of-the-week:** 
Python is a very useful language for quick scripting as it has a variety of libraries available, lots of support, and is quick and simple to type. Just watch out for types though since there is no compiler that checks type safety! You might just run into the errors when you run your program.

**Todo: Get ready for break.**
