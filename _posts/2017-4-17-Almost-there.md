title: Almost There
---

It is almost the end of the semester. We are almost there with the group project and with all of our classes. If you are senior then you are almost done with school!

### What did you do this past week?
This past week we worked on some of the project stuff. Specifically I worked on the backend and the search functionality. For this we took a query string and then looked through all of the string to parse the words and then queried the database on what word is present in the database or not. Then we are able to return the results to the front end using json format. This allows searches for single words and multiple words and our search also returns results for partial matches when multiple words are submitted.

### Whatâ€™s in your way?
This last week has been very busy just with lots of classes and work and things to do. This week there is still many things to do, things to grade and assignments to be working on. This is once again due to the fact that I am almost graduating and need to get my life together as well. So I believe like most people think, we just have things to do. I believe that it is better if we are able to plan efficiently for our lives this way we can try to get what we want done.

### What will you do next week?
Next week we will be finishing up our group project and we will be able to start wrapping it up. Then it will just be the actual presentations from there!

### This Class
This class is very helpful on being able to learn at least a bit of technologies that I have not used before. We have been needed to collaborate alot so I have enjoyed just experiencing and learning how to work with other people together.

**Tip-of-the-week:** AWS QuickSight is a tool to use for data visualization. It gives easy access to your Amazon data and allows you to plot your data in a nice and simple way.

**Todo: Continue to work on the group project.**
