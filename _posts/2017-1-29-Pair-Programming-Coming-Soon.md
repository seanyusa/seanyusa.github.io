title: Pair Programming Coming Soon!
---

### What did you do this past week?

This week in class we did a bit of coding and then learned some things about Python by looking through some code examples. We learned that Python handles exceptions by using a try except else finally block. We also took a look at some code for writing factorial with different versions including iterative, recursive, and one using reduce.

### What's in your way?

I wanted to setup a nice routine to be able to have time to excercise and do homework but it looks like I am still the greatest obstacle to that. I need to find some time to plan out blocks of time to work on assignments and projects and then also be able to setup a workout schedule.

### What will you do next week?

Next week I'm going to continue doing my school routine which involves reading the bible, doing homework for Software Design and Software Engineering, TAing Elements of Databases, and also trying to keep a routine excercise schedule if it all works out as planned.

### This Class

I think that this class is a nice balance of reading and homework. It has a nice self paced project that we get to plan ourselves, design, and work on it. I actually can't wait to get to the group assignment especially having read the pair programming article. I want to be able to experience the group work mentality to be able to relay ideas off my partner and hopefully be able to work more quickly and at the same time more efficiently. 

**Tip-of-the-week:** 
[Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com) is an online program for creating diagrams and charts of all kinds. I've been using it for Elements of Databases and Software Engineering to create nice looking UML diagrams for databases!

**Todo: Finish Collatz project by Thursday.**
