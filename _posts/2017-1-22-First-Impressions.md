This is sort of interesting, being forced to write a blog. Hopefully will be able to allow my writing skills to improve and also rethink about what we have been doing in class each week. I'm thinking maybe I can also put some reminders (or todos) for myself each week at the bottom of each post. Now for the mandatory questions. :)

### What did you do this past week?

This week I went to my classes. I had some opportunity to scout out my classes and see how much projects and assignments that I will have this semester.

### What's in your way?

I was hoping to setup a routine schedule for myself including some gym time and time for homework as well. The main thing in the way would be myself. I don't always have the self control to do what I would like to do. So hopefully I will be able to establish a nice routine schedule to help me be able to accomplish my school and personal tasks.

### What will you do next week?

Next week I'm going to continue to get settled into school and hopefully be able to begin setting up my daily routine so that I will be able to have a successful semester!

### This Class

I think this would be a pretty nice class. I actually enjoy this assignment, something not too time consuming but still have to do. I took Fraij's Algorithms class and enjoyed it so I've decided take this class with him as well! Hopefully it's just as interesting if not more. I've heard good things about this class and hope that I will learn more useful things for industry.

**Tip-of-the-week:** 
[Stache](https://stache.security.utexas.edu) is a service created by UT Austin for secure sharing and backups of sensitive data available to all UT students (I believe). Check it out and maybe you might have a use case for it!

**Todo: Finish Collatz base program and connection with Travis.**
