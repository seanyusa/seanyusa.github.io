Seems like this past week in class was a bit lesser in material since we had a guest lecturer and Dr. Fraij wasn't here on thursday as well. I enjoyed the guest lecture as I always enjoy listening to what people do as I am graduating soon but still do not know what exactly I enjoy in computer science or programming. I hope that through learning about what others do it would be able to peak my interest and I would investigate to see if that topic is something I particularly enjoy or not.

### What did you do this past week?

I continued to finish our Netflix project and I also worked a bit on my software design assignments. I learned more about python unpacking also in class from Seth.

### What's in your way?

I still want to get more excercise in my routine eventhough I started a bit this past week. I think the biggest things are school and obviously still myself. I got to get over myself!

### What will you do next week?

I need to start studying for my Software Design class so that I don't fail my class! Also we'll be getting our next assignment for Software Engineering so it'll be interesting to see what that is.

### This Class

So far the pair programming on the project has been going weel. I think it is much easier to get more confident about the code that is produced when there are two people looking at it. I heard that we might end up with more people in each group for future projects so that might be fun. Hopefully!

**Tip-of-the-week:** 
For the people who enjoy making music with their computers, [Omnisphere](https://www.spectrasonics.net/products/omnisphere/) is a nice virtual instrument which can produce some cool sounds. It pretty expensive thought!

**Todo: Study for Software Design.**
